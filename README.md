# Split Second

My take on the 2019 GMTK game jam theme "only one".

In Split Second the player automatically moves forward and when it is close to an enemy or an obstacle, you will only have one second to select the correct action.

You can play with a keyboard, a controller or a mouse/touchscreen.

 * Keyboard: left, up and right arrow keys to select the action.
 * Controller (Xbox): X, Y and B buttons keys to select the action.
 * Mouse/touchscreen: just click/tap the buttons

If you encounter any issue to play the game in your browser, try with Google Chrome, it seems to work the best.

This game was developed using [Godot 3.1](https://godotengine.org/) and can be played online [here](https://benjaminnavarro.itch.io/splitsecond).

Hope you like QTEs ;)
